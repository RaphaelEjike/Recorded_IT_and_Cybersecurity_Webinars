Over the past few years, I have attended or watched numerous webinars that have significantly shaped my knowledge and perspective. Each one has left an indelible mark, offering insights and inspiration that I continue to value. Below is a list of some of the most impactful webinars focused on reactive and proactive threat hunting, along with a brief description of what stood out to me the most about each one.

Attending these webinars has been an enriching experience, each one contributing to my professional growth in unique ways. I hope this list inspires you to explore these topics further and find value in the recorded sessions as much as I did.


## 1. Investigating WMI Attacks (https://youtu.be/aBQ1vEjK6v4?si=46XJ8n4EXO62vs7Z)

What I Liked:
- The webinar, presented by SANS Senior Instructor Chad Tilbury, delves into the increasingly sophisticated realm of WMI-based attacks, a topic that is both timely and crucial for modern cybersecurity. One aspect that stood out to me was the comprehensive overview of the current state of WMI hacking, enriched with real-world examples of both nation-state and criminal actor tradecraft. These insights provided a stark reminder of the evolving threat landscape and the advanced tactics employed by adversaries.

- Another highlight was the detailed discussion on detection tools and analysis techniques. The webinar didn't just identify the problem; it equipped viewers with actionable steps to address the threat, making it an invaluable resource for security teams looking to enhance their defenses. The practical, step-by-step guidance on increasing an organization's security posture was particularly useful, ensuring that the information shared was not just theoretical but readily applicable.

## 2. The Truth about Ransomware: Its not Complicated! (https://youtu.be/8xAuvl0Cp90?si=legZQxtyjPjuJD5B)

What I Liked:

- This webinar by Ryan Chapman and Rob Lee tackled the pervasive threat of ransomware with both depth and clarity. One aspect that stood out was the demystification of ransomware attacks. Contrary to popular belief, the speakers highlighted that many ransomware attacks are opportunistic and often leverage insecure configurations. This was a crucial point, emphasizing that these attacks aren't always the work of highly skilled threat actors, but rather a result of vulnerabilities that can be managed and mitigated.

- I appreciated the thorough explanation of the different entities involved in a typical ransomware attack, including initial access brokers (IABs), paid "pentester" affiliates, and money mules. This breakdown provided a clear picture of the ecosystem behind these attacks, helping to understand the various stages and actors involved.

- The practical advice on keeping these groups out of networks was incredibly valuable. The emphasis on awareness and diligence as key factors in thwarting ransomware was particularly empowering. The session provided actionable steps for detection and response, ensuring that organizations can be better prepared to handle ransomware threats.
