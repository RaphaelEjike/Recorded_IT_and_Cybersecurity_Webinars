What I Liked:
- The webinar, presented by SANS Senior Instructor Chad Tilbury, delves into the increasingly sophisticated realm of WMI-based attacks, a topic that is both timely and crucial for modern cybersecurity. One aspect that stood out to me was the comprehensive overview of the current state of WMI hacking, enriched with real-world examples of both nation-state and criminal actor tradecraft. These insights provided a stark reminder of the evolving threat landscape and the advanced tactics employed by adversaries.

- Another highlight was the detailed discussion on detection tools and analysis techniques. The webinar didn't just identify the problem; it equipped viewers with actionable steps to address the threat, making it an invaluable resource for security teams looking to enhance their defenses. The practical, step-by-step guidance on increasing an organization's security posture was particularly useful, ensuring that the information shared was not just theoretical but readily applicable.
