## 1. Investigating WMI Attacks | SANS (https://youtu.be/aBQ1vEjK6v4?si=46XJ8n4EXO62vs7Z)

What I Liked:
- The webinar, presented by SANS Senior Instructor Chad Tilbury, delves into the increasingly sophisticated realm of WMI-based attacks, a topic that is both timely and crucial for modern cybersecurity. One aspect that stood out to me was the comprehensive overview of the current state of WMI hacking, enriched with real-world examples of both nation-state and criminal actor tradecraft. These insights provided a stark reminder of the evolving threat landscape and the advanced tactics employed by adversaries.

- Another highlight was the detailed discussion on detection tools and analysis techniques. The webinar didn't just identify the problem; it equipped viewers with actionable steps to address the threat, making it an invaluable resource for security teams looking to enhance their defenses. The practical, step-by-step guidance on increasing an organization's security posture was particularly useful, ensuring that the information shared was not just theoretical but readily applicable.

## 2. The Truth about Ransomware: Its not Complicated! | SANS (https://youtu.be/8xAuvl0Cp90?si=legZQxtyjPjuJD5B)

What I Liked:

- This webinar by Ryan Chapman and Rob Lee tackled the pervasive threat of ransomware with both depth and clarity. One aspect that stood out was the demystification of ransomware attacks. Contrary to popular belief, the speakers highlighted that many ransomware attacks are opportunistic and often leverage insecure configurations. This was a crucial point, emphasizing that these attacks aren't always the work of highly skilled threat actors, but rather a result of vulnerabilities that can be managed and mitigated.

- I appreciated the thorough explanation of the different entities involved in a typical ransomware attack, including initial access brokers (IABs), paid "pentester" affiliates, and money mules. This breakdown provided a clear picture of the ecosystem behind these attacks, helping to understand the various stages and actors involved.

- The practical advice on keeping these groups out of networks was incredibly valuable. The emphasis on awareness and diligence as key factors in thwarting ransomware was particularly empowering. The session provided actionable steps for detection and response, ensuring that organizations can be better prepared to handle ransomware threats.

## 3. Grow Up! Evaluating and Maturing Your SOC Using MITRE ATT&CK | ATT&CKcon 4.0 (https://youtu.be/8qvP5uDB2wc?si=1B0K4hVCLjzHhp-n)

What I Liked:

- Lauren Brennan's webinar on evaluating the maturity of security operations programs provided a wealth of knowledge and practical insights. One key aspect that stood out was the emphasis on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. The presentation clearly demonstrated how this framework can be utilized to comprehensively evaluate and enhance a SOC's maturity.

- I particularly appreciated the detailed discussion on best practices for evaluations. Lauren’s approach to breaking down the complexities of security operations into manageable components—covering people, processes, and technologies—was incredibly helpful. This holistic view made the task of growing and optimizing a SOC seem much more approachable.

- The session's focus on identifying gaps and improving security posture through foundational activities was both practical and actionable. The step-by-step guidance provided clear strategies that can be immediately implemented to bolster security operations.


## 4. Find_Evil - Threat Hunting | SANS (https://youtu.be/GrhVz1Sjd_0?si=ycnJQdEEyPu_WZvt)

What I Liked:

- Anurag Khanna's webinar on threat hunting provided invaluable insights into a proactive approach to cybersecurity. One of the most impactful aspects was the discussion on the fundamentals of threat hunting. Understanding the importance of proactively looking for threats, rather than just reacting to them, was a game-changer. This shift in mindset is crucial for staying ahead of adversaries.

- I also appreciated the detailed explanation of what hunting teams should look for and how to collect and analyze relevant data. The practical, step-by-step guidance on conducting effective threat hunting was incredibly useful, offering clear, actionable steps that can be implemented in any organization.

- Additionally, the "recipes" for performing threat hunting were a highlight. These practical examples provided concrete methods for identifying and mitigating threats, making the concept of threat hunting accessible and understandable.

## 5. Detecting & Hunting Ransomware Operator Tools: It Is Easier Than You Think! (https://youtu.be/oMAvSpq9fYY?si=W3rEKARR13Om9pCN)

What I Liked:

- Ryan Chapman's webinar provided an insightful overview of the tools often leveraged by ransomware operators. One of the most compelling aspects was the detailed exploration of the tools and projects frequently used in ransomware operations, such as Living Off Trusted Sites (LOTS) and Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD). Understanding these tools' roles and their forensic implications was incredibly enlightening.

- I appreciated how Ryan broke down complex topics, such as the forensic workings of PsExec-like tools and the importance of hunting for rogue installations of Remote Monitoring & Maintenance (RMM) tools. This detailed analysis offered practical insights into detecting and preventing ransomware activities, making the information highly actionable.

- The discussion on data exfiltration tools like Winzip, 7Zip, WinSCP, FileZilla, Rclone, and MEGAsync was particularly fascinating. Learning how these tools leave forensic artifacts that can be used by defenders was a valuable takeaway. It underscored the importance of thorough forensic analysis in identifying and responding to ransomware threats.


## 6. The Cycle of Cyber Threat Intelligence | SANS (https://youtu.be/J7e74QLVxCk?si=6AQlzojfo84-cfbm)

What I Liked:

- Katie Nickels' webinar on cyber threat intelligence (CTI) offered an in-depth exploration of the traditional Intelligence Cycle, a crucial process for ensuring effective CTI. One of the standout aspects was the clear and structured explanation of each phase of the Intelligence Cycle—planning, collection, processing, analysis, and dissemination. This comprehensive coverage provided a solid foundation for understanding how CTI should be conducted to drive better decision-making.

- I appreciated the practical insights and key considerations shared for each phase of the cycle. Katie's ability to break down complex concepts into understandable and actionable steps was particularly valuable, making the material accessible even to those new to CTI.

- Another highlight was the integration of real-world examples and best practices. Learning from Katie's extensive experience in network defense, incident response, and cyber threat intelligence added immense value to the session. Her liberal arts background and dedication to inspiring young women in STEM through programs like the Cyberjutsu Girls Academy also underscored the diverse approaches and inclusive mindset she brings to the field.
